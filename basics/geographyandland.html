                <p>Making people is all fine and good, but you can’t have a complete story world without a place for them to live! Making the literal planet or country that your story takes place in is a lot of fun, and this is the way I do it.</p>
                <p>I used to balk at creating entire new countries and worlds for my stories, and as such, a lot of my stories took place in a slightly modified Earth. This is definitely a valid setting to use for a fantasy or science fiction story as well, and I’ll cover some of the ways to do that, but first, we’re going to talk about creating a planet or country from scratch.</p>
                <p>Like creating an entire race (or more than once race!) of people, this can seem like an immense task, and not one you might want to spend time on. However, if you are writing a story in a world completely of your own creation, fleshing out the land and geography is a very important thing to do. And as with creating a race of people, start small and vague.</p>
                <p>First, think about the immediate setting of the story, if you have one (and if you don’t have a vague idea of a setting yet, definitely think of one before you begin worldbuilding!). Is it in somewhere tropical? A desert? A city? A suburb? Somewhere very dangerous? It’s this first flicker of an idea that can lead to the expansion of the land you’re working with. For instance, the current storyworld I’m writing in now began as just a snowy region in the north. Now it’s a full-fledged continent with many different terrains and cultures.</p>
                <p>Once you have that idea, expand on it. Where is it located, exactly? Is this part of a continent? Is it an island on its own? North, south, east, west? It’s a good idea to at least start with a large landmass, whether that be an island that contains only your country, or a continent that has many countries. Mine in particular is a large, planet-spanning continent with eight countries, and it is sort of like Pangaea in that it is the only continent on the planet. In another story of mine, though, the planet contains many countries, and each of them is an island. They are all connected to each other by either manufactured bridges or land bridges. You can create a lot of variety with the landmass alone.</p>
                <p>Climate is another important thing to consider. The climate will definitely have an effect on the lifestyles of your characters, and you should make it apparent in your story. For instance, if a character lives in a desert area, they might have water problems or heat problems. There won’t be the type of animal that lives in a tropical rainforest, for instance. Climate can differ in each part of the land, too, depending on how big your land mass is!</p>
                <br>
                <p>Here are some general things to remember when you’re thinking about climate:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The poles of a planet, which are furthest away from the sun, will generally have the coldest weather. And in contrast, areas near the equator will be the warmest.</li>
                    <li>Climate is a gradient. Unless you have something weird and supernatural going on, a very hot desert is not likely to border a snowy tundra region. Climate changes gradually as you travel the planet. There are no drastic lines where different climates cut off.</li>
                    <li>Areas near the coasts of oceans tend to be milder, with less extreme temperature differences (the UK generally has pretty mild, rainy weather, since nearly all its land is within a short distance of the ocean compared to a larger country like America). Areas toward the middle of the continent away from the coast tend to have more extreme temperatures (the Midwest US, for instance, has very hot summers and very cold winters).</li>
                    <li>Seasons are important too. You can go with the standard four seasons we observe today, or you can have rainy and dry seasons as well. Alternatively, you can make up your own seasons. Just make sure they make sense.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Once you’ve got the climate and land mass taken care of, you can begin to map. You can either draw the map in a program such as GIMP or Paint, or you can use a mapping program, like AutoRealm. I draw them because I find it easier, but I’ve used AutoRealm in the past and it’s a pretty nice program (and free!).</p>
                <br>
                <p>When you are mapping, you can put all sorts of things on the map. Obviously, you will be drawing how the main land mass looks, as well as the water around it. Aside from that, however, here are some ideas for what you can add to your map:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Borders marking out where the countries are. If you’re really into it, and the countries are large, you can even add states.</li>
                    <li>Major cities are important too, especially the capitals of countries.</li>
                    <li>In addition to the ocean, you can have other sources of water such as rivers and lakes. When you’re making cities, the biggest cities are usually closest to a source of water. Sources of water can come from aquifers, too, which are underground, but the oldest cities tended to form around rivers or lakes. Water is important.</li>
                    <li>Map what the land looks like. Mountains, prairies, deserts, hills, plateaus, marshes, coasts, volcanic regions, tundra, etc.</li>
                    <li>Major landmarks, tourist attractions, historic sites, religious sites, or monuments.</li>
                    <li>Railroads, roads, or other routes of travel between cities (depending on the technological level of your society).</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Designing the land of a particular world can take a long time, but hopefully these pointers can get you started in the right direction. If you spend a lot of time building your world, your story will be the better for it, and will be more lush with detail. The most interesting stories often have some of the most memorable worlds. Good luck!</p>
